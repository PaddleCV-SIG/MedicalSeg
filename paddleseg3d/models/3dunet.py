    3DUnet model from
    `"3D U-Net: Learning Dense Volumetric Segmentation from Sparse Annotation"
        <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.06650.pdf>`.

    Uses `DoubleConv` as a basic_module and nearest neighbor upsampling in the decoder

    Args:
        in_channels (int): number of input channels
        out_channels (int): number of output segmentation masks;
            Note that that the of out_channels might correspond to either
            different semantic classes or to different binary segmentation mask.
            It's up to the user of the class to interpret the out_channels and
            use the proper loss criterion during training (i.e. CrossEntropyLoss (multi-class)
            or BCEWithLogitsLoss (two-class) respectively)
        f_maps (int, tuple): number of feature maps at each level of the encoder; if it's an integer the number
            of feature maps is given by the geometric progression: f_maps ^ k, k=1,2,3,4
        final_sigmoid (bool): if True apply element-wise nn.Sigmoid after the
            final 1x1 convolution, otherwise apply nn.Softmax. MUST be True if nn.BCELoss (two-class) is used
            to train the model. MUST be False if nn.CrossEntropyLoss (multi-class) is used to train the model.
        basic_module: basic model for the encoder/decoder (DoubleConv, ExtResNetBlock, ....)
        layer_order (string): determines the order of layers
            in `SingleConv` module. e.g. 'crg' stands for Conv3d+ReLU+GroupNorm3d.
            See `SingleConv` for more info
        num_groups (int): number of groups for the GroupNorm
        num_levels (int): number of levels in the encoder/decoder path (applied only if f_maps is an int)
        is_segmentation (bool): if True (semantic segmentation problem) Sigmoid/Softmax normalization is applied
            after the final convolution; if False (regression problem) the normalization layer is skipped at the end
        testing (bool): if True (testing mode) the `final_activation` (if present, i.e. `is_segmentation=true`)
            will be applied as the last operation during the forward pass; if False the model is in training mode
            and the `final_activation` (even if present) won't be applied; default: False
        conv_kernel_size (int or tuple): size of the convolving kernel in the basic_module
        pool_kernel_size (int or tuple): the size of the window
        conv_padding (int or tuple): add zero-padding added to all three sides of the input
